# Bike Sales Strategic Analysis (Excel & Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of 1,000 customer records to identify key purchasing trends for a bike retail store. The primary objective was to determine which demographic factors—such as age, income, and commute distance—most strongly correlate with a customer's decision to purchase a bike.

To ensure data accuracy and demonstrate cross-platform proficiency, this analysis was performed using a **dual-platform strategy**:
1.  **Microsoft Excel:** For initial data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and pivot table logic.
2.  **Tableau:** For building a scalable, globally accessible dashboard and validating Excel findings.
